# Streaming Website

A live-streaming web application similar to Twitch. Users will be able to sign up and start a stream or view an existing stream made by another user. There will be a chat window where users can write something that they would like to communicate with the streamer and other users watching the stream. Users will also be able to make donations to the streamer.
